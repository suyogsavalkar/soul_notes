# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Solo note-taking app's user interface with improved note previews, search functionality, and navigation controls. The enhancements focus on making note discovery and navigation more efficient while maintaining the app's clean, distraction-free design philosophy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see more content in note previews so that I can better identify notes without opening them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the notes grid THEN the note preview cards SHALL display up to 5 lines of content instead of the current 2 lines
2. WHEN content exceeds 5 lines THEN the preview SHALL truncate with an ellipsis indicator
3. WHEN the preview is extended THEN the card layout SHALL maintain visual consistency and proper spacing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through all my notes by title and content so that I can quickly find specific information across categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the "General" category view THEN I SHALL see a search text box prominently displayed
2. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL search both note titles and content in real-time
3. WHEN search results are found THEN the grid view SHALL display matching notes from all categories
4. WHEN I click on a search result note THEN the system SHALL open that specific note in the editor
5. WHEN the search box is empty THEN the system SHALL display all notes in the current category as normal
6. WHEN no search results are found THEN the grid view SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a close button in the note editor so that I can quickly return to the category view without using keyboard shortcuts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the note editor view THEN I SHALL see a small cross icon in the top-right section of the editor controls
2. WHEN I hover over the close button THEN it SHALL display a subtle red hover effect
3. WHEN I click the close button THEN the system SHALL close the current note and return me to the category view that contains the note
4. WHEN I close a note with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL follow existing auto-save behavior before closing
5. WHEN the close button is displayed THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing editor controls or layout
